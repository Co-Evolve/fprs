FPRS stands for Framework for defining Parameterized Robot Specifications.

This framework defines abstract classes that can simplify and standardize the definition and creation of
parameterized robot specifications to be used for optimization. We define a robot as a combination of a morphology
and controller, each of which is defined by its own parameterized specification.
